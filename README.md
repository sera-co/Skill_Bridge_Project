## Problem Statement

Learners often struggle to identify the right sequence of courses, projects, and resources to acquire new skills or pursue a career.  
Scattered online materials, inconsistent guidance, and lack of personalized learning paths lead to wasted time and confusion.

**SkillBridge** solves this by generating AI-driven, step-by-step learning roadmaps tailored to each user’s goals, current level, and preferences — ensuring efficient, motivating, and goal-oriented learning.

## Core Components

### UI
- Web App built using React.js and Tailwind CSS  
- Clean input forms to capture learning goals, skill levels, and preferences  
- Dynamic dashboard to display AI-generated roadmaps and resources  
- Real-time progress tracking and seamless navigation  

### LLM API
- Uses OpenAI API to generate personalized, structured learning paths  
- Converts user input (like “Web Development” or “AI Fundamentals”) into detailed roadmaps  
- Suggests projects, resources, and timelines to achieve each milestone  

### Tools
- **Database:** MongoDB for user profiles, roadmaps, and progress data  
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for handling routes, logic, and AI integration  
- **Authentication:** JWT-based secure login system  
- **Axios:** For smooth frontend-backend communication  
- **Environment Management:** dotenv for managing API keys and configurations

## Backend Explanation

The backend of SkillBridge is built with Node.js and Express.js. It handles user authentication, roadmap generation, progress updates, and AI responses.

### Backend Features
- Secure signup and login using JWT authentication  
- AI-powered roadmap generation using OpenAI API through `aiController.js`  
- `roadmapController.js` for managing user-specific roadmaps (CRUD operations)  
- Stores user profiles, preferences, and progress data in MongoDB  
- RESTful API structure for modular, maintainable code  

### Important Backend Files
- **server.js** – Entry point of the backend server  
- **Controllers**
  - `authController.js` – Handles user authentication  
  - `aiController.js` – Handles AI-generated roadmaps  
  - `roadmapController.js` – Manages roadmap creation, retrieval, and updates  
- **Models**
  - `user.js` – Stores user schema  
  - `roadmap.js` – Stores AI-generated roadmap structure  
  - `resourceLibrary.js` – Stores course and learning resource data  
- **Middleware**
  - `authMiddleware.js` – Protects routes with authentication

## How It Works

1. User signs up or logs in to the SkillBridge platform.  
2. The user enters their learning or career goal.  
3. The AI generates a structured, step-by-step roadmap.  
4. The roadmap includes stages, projects, and course resources.  
5. The user can update progress and revisit previous milestones anytime.  

---

## Deployment Workflow

1. Build the frontend using `npm run build`.  
2. Deploy the build directory to **Netlify**.  
3. Deploy the backend server using **Render**.  
4. Connect both with API URLs defined in `.env` file.  
5. Test routes, authentication, and AI generation functionality.
